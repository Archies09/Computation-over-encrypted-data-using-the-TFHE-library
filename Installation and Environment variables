<See list of options>
by default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
DO NOT CHANGE IT
Keep other options as it is.
You may then configure which fft processor to use. If you have a recent Core i7 processor, enabling the SPQLIOS_FMA version in optimized mode whil likely give you the fastest running times. If you have an older CPU that does not support the latest FMA opcodes, you can revert to other fft processors. The nayuki-portable processor is slower, but will run on any hardware.

ENABLE_SPQLIOS_AVX	works on i5
ENABLE_SPQLIOS_FMA	works on i7
ENABLE_NAYUKI_PORTABLE	works everywhere
